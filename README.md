This repository demonstrates an uncommon Perl bug related to how the language handles strings containing embedded null characters ('\0').  The `bug.pl` script showcases the unexpected behavior, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version. The issue arises because many Perl string functions treat the null character as a string terminator, leading to truncated output and inaccurate length calculations.

**Problem:** Perl's built-in functions like `length` may not correctly measure the length of a string containing null characters.  Output operations might also stop at the null byte.

**Solution:**  Proper handling requires being aware of the null character's special meaning and using methods that explicitly handle binary data, if the null character should not act as a terminator.

**How to reproduce:**
1. Run `bug.pl`.
2. Observe the incorrect string length and truncated output.
3. Run `bugSolution.pl` to see the correct handling of the string.
